Whenever I teach a finance class I try to throw in this question, what separates you from Warren Buffet? How are you different? The naturally first answer is the billions of dollar difference in net wealth… sure. 

The aim of the question is to get my students thinking about decision making and how Warren Buffets decision-making is different to theirs. Warren Buffet follows a distinct and rigorous decision-making process and framework. He carefully makes decisions. 

I think that what differentiates most successful people from myself is mainly and largely in part their ability to make better decisions than me. By this I mean followed a structured, well-thought-out and rational decision path. I initially felt a lot of pressure to make the right decision all of the time until I read one of his quotes, he once said: “You only have to do a very few things right in your life so long as you don’t do too many things wrong.” That does make me feel better. 

I generally worry about and think about pay cheque cycle decisions and by this, I mean the decisions I need to make in-between receiving my salary or wages. How much to I save and where, how much should I spend here and there, how much should I pay off my mortgage, what does my family need in terms of time, focus and energy. Seems small and short-term thinking but I feel if I get these right more often than not, in the end it will be more positive than negative. I reflect on what is important for me to focus on this cycle and my top three priorities are the “TRIPLE F”: Finances, Family and Friends. 

I reflect on my decision making a bit and if I made the right calls and if not – where I would change it in the future. But the biggest regret I usually have is when I didn’t make a decision at all. In my mind you always have three options:

1. ```
   Yes – followed by some action,
   ```
2. ```
   No – followed by some action or
   ```
3. ```
   Not making a decision – followed by inaction.  
   ```

I’ve realized not deciding is really a decision point too. It just comes with inaction or inertia. In Physics, Inertia is defined as: “a property of matter by which it continues in its existing state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line, unless that state is changed by an external force.” Feels to me that sometimes when I don’t decide, I’m floating along and potentially not in the driver’s seat. 

I’ve concluded that not making a decision, is also making a decision. In my case and generally: If it’s not a yes, it’s a no. 

I found this article pretty interesting: [“Warren Buffett Believes 1 Big Decision in Life Will Be the Difference Between Succeeding and Failing, by Michael Schwantes – 9 July 2024. ](https://www.inc-aus.com/marcel-schwantes/warren-buffett-believes-1-big-decision-in-life-will-lead-to-success.html#:~:text=Buffett%20once%20said%2C%20%22You%20only,solid%2C%20wise%20choices%20every%20day.)
