I’m not overly religious, I grew up in a Catholic home and consider myself Catholic – most definitely not the best Catholic I admit. My wife is Anglican, and my late father-in-law was Jewish, and my late mother-in-law was Anglican. My wife’s uncle is a practicing Jew and his wife, and sons are practices Jews. When my wife’s cousins turned 13, they celebrated their Bar mitzvah, it was my first opportunity to attend Shul and my first Bar mitzvah.

I thought I’d embrace it and enjoy the experience, wore a yarmulke and sat in Shul. It was great – I enjoyed it, didn’t understand 99% of what went down but people were friendly and welcoming. 

At one point the Rabbi began to give his derasha, in Judaism, a homily or sermon. In his sermon the Rabbi told a story of a man who prayed every day to God. He prayed every single day and asked to win the lottery jackpot. Each week that past, he didn’t win the lottery. But he continued to pray and ask God to let him win the lottery. Years past and no jackpot win came about for the man. The man one day passed away and met God in heaven and the man asked God a question. He said, God I prayed every day of my adult life and ask to win the lottery and still, I didn’t win. Why? God responded and said, “You never bought a ticket! I was waiting for you to buy a lottery ticket to win.” 

At first, I thought, this story has no place in a place of worship. But then the Rabbi explained that the story is about being in the game, participating, and putting yourself into the best possible position to one be lucky. Its about being in it to win it.

I took the notion of “buying a ticket and being in the game” into investing, you can’t earn interest or see your shares grow if you’re not invested. You have to be in a share to reap the rewards, you have to invest to earn that invest. By sitting on the sidelines, you’re not going to win the lottery and similarly the more you practice the luckier you’ll be.
