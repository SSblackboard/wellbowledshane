I don’t know why this is true for me and it’s a weird one. I have never and will never fully trust a man who wears a Pinky ring – this is a ring or any sort on their baby (outside finger). Yes, this is solely a male gender issue – directed only at men, so excuse me for this. 

I have special issues with the Pinky rings that display a family crest imprinted into a yellow gold ring – you know who I’m talking directly to…and its mostly investment bankers.

Example found on Etsy:

I have no direct and quantifiable evidence to support my theory, but whenever I meet or talk to a man who wears a Pinky ring, my spider senses flare up. I get a gut instinct that this person isn’t genuine and is driven greed. I get a sense that this person is avaricious, meaning they are driven and concerned solely with personal gain. The new word for the day is **avaricious** and it suggests that this person will do anything to achieve material gain, and in general, not a pleasant attribute. 

It’s maybe a bias I have – sure it could be. It could be from experience – sure it could be. But listening to my gut instinct has worked out more than not for me. 

Trust your gut, the little voice in your head, listen to reason and if you’re in doubt even the slightest – get independent third-party advice.
