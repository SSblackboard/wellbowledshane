This article is not about religion, it’s about a mindset of self-reliance. 

There was a time in my life where I thought that one day I’d win the lottery or find that one stock that grew 10,000% overnight to make me an instant millionaire. Or put another way, that something luck would happen to me, or someone would come and ‘save’ me and hand me a golden parachute. Naive I know.  Crazy – probably.

I very quickly was introduced to the real world and soon realised that there is no one coming to save me – it’s up to me. Everyone in my life will come and go, some by choice others not by choice. But I will always have me. I need to take control, and especially of my finances and make decisions for me. Sounds selfish but if I’m in control of my finances and working towards my goals – my family is in a better position. By control I mean, I’m budgeting, saving and investing my money to grow into the future. 

I’m trying to make considered, and well-planned financial decisions – not to please everyone, but to set myself and family up for a future where we are financial independent. I’m not going to be a multi-millionaire living it up on a yacht, but being debt free, owing my house outright, having enough saved to live a comfortable life are my goals.    

I’ve realised the way I do this will not come from one huge event, but through a million tiny events. It’s through small decision each pay cycle that will get me to where I want to be. Saving comes from small deposits each pay cycle that over time build up. Its small extra payments onto my mortgage. It’s through avoiding bad expenses one at a time, that I’m going to get to where I want to be. I follow three rules: 

1. ```
   Start small, start big, start tomorrow – but start. 
   ```

* Habits build over time, but you need to start. Anywhere. 

2. ```
   You’ll have ups and downs, wins and losses but keep going.
   ```

   * Nothing goes to plan all of the time; you’ll win and lose but don’t stop. Keep at it. 
3. ```
   It doesn’t matter what everyone else is doing – it only matters what you do. 
   ```

   * The only thing that matters is your behaviour and decisions. It’s not about everyone else – it’s all about what I am doing. I’m not here to please strangers, I need to look at my kids and wife in the eyes and tell them I’m doing everything to secure our future.  
   * An example of this for me is Black Friday sales. I **NEVER** buy anything on black Friday sales – out of principle. I’m not saving anything on Black Friday – I’m spending money. ‘Save 90% on deals” – No thanks. I’ll save 100% of my money but not participating. People have said to me, buy what about something you’re planning on buying and you just delay that until a black Friday sale, so you get a better deal? Maybe that works out cheaper, but those same friends don’t delay their purchases until black Friday Sales – they just buy unnecessary and impulse buys.   #AntiBlackFridaySale – I’m starting a movement, be a part of it – just kidding, it doesn’t matter what everyone else is doing, it only matters what I’m doing. 

**I’m responsible for myself and my finances**, if that means I need to upskill myself or improve my understanding of something – that’s what I’ll do. I’m not waiting for the crowd or someone to magically appear to save me. No one looks after me – I look after myself and my ability to do so it is within my control.
