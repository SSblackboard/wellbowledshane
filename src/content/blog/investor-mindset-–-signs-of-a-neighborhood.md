Iâ€™ve bought five properties and sold four in my life. So, take any tips or hints from this article with a pinch of salt â€“ knowing Iâ€™m not an experienced real estate, nor trained whatsoever in the real estate industry. 

I understand high level drivers and rules in the real estate market like supply and demand, location, size, zoning and the likes. All the desktop research is fine and tells you a lot about what a property is worth or should be priced at â€“ considering recent sales, like for like comparison, suburb averagesâ€¦etc. 

Looking at the specific asset (house) and its state, functionality and layout all add to its alure and valuation â€“ thatâ€™s fine. What Iâ€™d like to talk about is the neighborhood and the intangibles that could tell me something more about the prospects of the neighborhood. 

I have mental rules, call them shortcuts, call them biases â€“ but they are ways I get an impression of a neighborhood that adds to the information about it. Letâ€™s be cautious when using them â€“ they are not based on any facts, figures or evidence â€“ they are purely gut feelings I get.  

I have five shortcuts that provide me â€˜intangibleâ€™ neighborhood information: 

1. 	The more abandoned shopping trolleys you see in a neighborhood â€“ the worse that neighborhood is. 
2. 	The more joggers and runners you see in a neighborhood, the higher the rents and potentially higher property values. 
3. 	The more established trees (large older trees) a neighborhood has, the more likely there is old money in those neighborhoods. 
4. 	The more cars â€˜being rebuiltâ€™ in the front or backyards â€“ is a red flag. 
5. 	The types of shops in the area tell you something. If they are Cafes â€“ cool. If they are bars â€“ unsure. If they are adult shops â€“ whoa, red flag. 



Again, there is zero evidence for this â€“ just a gut instinct that I get about those suburbs or neighborhoods that add to or detract from my want to live in that neighborhood. 

**Trolleys > joggers > trees > cars > adult shops** ðŸ˜Š
