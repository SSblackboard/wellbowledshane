What do Private Equity (PE) investors and criminal gangs have in common you ask… or may not have asked but I’ll tell you anyway. 

A deep-seated lack of trust for outsiders or new entrants. Let me explain… the vast majority of PE funded deals come from referrals within their network, very seldomly are deals done and successfully funded that originate from an entrepreneur or founder emailing their business plan to the PE firm – the equivalent of a cold call in the PE world. I’ll call it an exception to the rule if ‘cold’ deals are funded. 

Deals generally come to the PE firm from trusted sources. Advisors, other PE firms, Venture Capital investors and Angel investors that are known to the firm. This is that there is an existing and established relationship between the referring party and the PE firm. This relationship is one that is longstanding and proven through previously deals, engagements, qualifications, associations or golf club memberships.  

Criminal gangs usually do not share information, plans, details or the likes with any othersiders. For obvious reasons, they generally are illegal and if found out – could put may of the gangs’ members in jail. Within the hierarchy of a gang there’s usually layers or levels of trust and to graduate upwards this privilege is earned. It’s built over time and through a relationship (potentially a dysfunctional one) but it’s a relationship, nonetheless. Generally, if you haven’t grown up with the gang members, live in the same neighbourhood, or wear the right colours you are considered an outsider. 

PE investors and criminal gangs use trust as a currency, right of passage, right to access. Its within this relationship where trust is built over years that there exists confidence and conviction between parties. This matters in those worlds but I apply it to my world too. I consider how an opportunity finds its way to me – does it magically appear, or has it been brough up in discussion with a third party who I’ve known for a while and built a relationship with. 

I’ve realised the power of relationship building and the doors this opens. Not only for deals, but crucially for advice. Being able to pick up the phone and call on someone to ask their opinion or how they would approach something is truly valuable. As with PE investors and criminal gangs this is built over time, it takes effort and consistency to build.   

It takes a while when anyone new comes into my circle or network for me to trust them. Its funny when I receive spam or scam emails and straight away, they are trying to convince me that its alright to trust them and take them at their word. I know we’ve just met but trust me anyway.  

**Disclaimer:** This article in no way promotes the membership of criminal gangs, if that is what you got out of the article – please reread it. The point is to build relationships, expand networks and to earn those networks trust and vice versa.
