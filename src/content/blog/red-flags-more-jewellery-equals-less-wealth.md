I know what you are thinking, not another jewellery post and what does this guy have against people wearing Jewellery? And I get it, but this is happening and is a real thing – in my head. 

I’ve noticed somewhat of a trend. And it’s probably a confirmation bias that I subconsciously possess. I’ve noticed, generally and not all the time but most of the time – people who wear an unusually high amount of jewellery on their hands, around their necks and in their ears – generally are not the wealthiest people. Now, let me clarify that I have no financial evidence to back up that sweeping statement at all, it’s just a working theory based on what I’ve observed in my world. 

This is an opinion I have based purely on my experiences and what I’ve observed in my immediate environment. 

Run your own experiment, when you walk into a fancy establishment – take note of how much jewellery the men and women are wearing. Rings (if the men are wearing pinky rings  – get out and get out fast!), earrings, watches and necklaces. Then go visit a less fancy establishment and compare the quantity of jewellery on show.  If I was a betting man, the less fancy establishment would contain more jewellery. 

Now this is not to say that less wealth people hang out at less fancy places – keep it together, we’re focussed on the jewellery. There might be something to my observation, potentially its signally by people, potentially its an image to be portrayed, potentially it’s an asset allocation decision – I am not sure of any of it. 

I’ve added this crazy idea under red flags because its these biases or identified trends we as investors need to read, be aware of and consider when making important life choices. Consider the signals around you and what they are telling you and importantly what the other person is trying to tell you, or show you or make you believe is true.
