Am I the only one who thinks the idea of retirement, that is, working my whole life, saving up to fund time doing hobbies around the house or neighbourhood is a thing of the past. I have this notion in my head that retirement means sitting around watching TV, gardening, going for coffee and really just chilling out all day – everyday. 

Don’t get me wrong, there are days when I’d like to pack it all in and call it a day. There are times when I’m so tired that six months of not leaving the house could seriously work. 

There are many ‘new’ terms floating around like “Protirement”, meaning: Early retirement from professional working with the idea of pursuing something more fulfilling. Or “Pretirement”, meaning: the state or stage between the employment and retirement.

The notion of when a I hit an arbitrary age 65 or 67 – that’s it, I need to be sent to the pasture and left to my own devices. I personally have three issues with the traditional idea of retirement: 

**Firstly**, it assumes I have enough wealth saved up. How much is ever enough? All retirement and savings models have several assumptions built into their calculations, like: Interest rates, inflation rates, time, compounding, deposits…etc. An event or series of events can severely negatively impact the outcome of those calculations. And the further into the future I attempt to forecast the more uncertain my models become. 

**Secondly**, traditional retirement notions assume I’ll die before my wealth runs out, that is, my wealth will outlast me and not the other way around. This scares the life out of me, imagine running out of savings and I’m 85. Life expectancy has risen steadily, and people are now frequently living until 100. How much do I have to save now to fund myself for 35 odd years, probably more than I earn now. My biggest fear is relying on someone else to help me out in retirement, even worse still having to rely on whatever government is in power when I’m 85. 

**And thirdly**, what will I do to fill up my day – take a leaf out of Will Freeman (Hugh Grant’s character) in the movie: “About a Boy”:  

> “I find the key is to think of a day as units of time, each unit consisting of no more than thirty minutes. Full hours can be a little bit intimidating, and most activities take about half an hour. Taking a bath: one unit, watching countdown: one unit, web-based research: two units, exercising: three units, having my hair carefully dishevelled: four units. It's amazing how the day fills up, and I often wonder, to be absolutely honest, if I'd ever have time for a job; how do people cram them in?”

I have some colleagues that have bought into the FIRE movement - Financial Independence, Retire Early is an idea that promotes extreme savings and investments now and over a short-term period (i.e. buy the time they are 45) that allows them to retire much earlier the average person. If that works for them, sure go ahead – no judgement. I can’t see myself sacrificing 70% of my annual income into savings and investments to do this – my life would be awfully bland. I couldn’t imagine going without fun. [Check out FIRE explainer on Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-independence-retire-early-fire.asp). 

The idea of retirement for me, doesn’t exist. I’m going to be working in a job I love or for myself for well into my late 60’s, early 70s and maybe even longer. Scaling down to 4/3/2 days a week is an option but still earning an income, even if its my side hustle – I’ll still work to earn income later in my life. And maybe going back to study a new skills or qualification – why not!
