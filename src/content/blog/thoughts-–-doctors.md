I hope this article doesnâ€™t annoy anyone who has done their PhD, if it does then apologies in advance. 

I recently travelled to Sydney for work, and I was booking my flight ticket. As I was entering the destination, selecting my times and seats and then entering my personal details into the booking. The question asked for my title, as in Mr, Mrs, Drâ€¦etc. 

At this point â€“ I found myself stuck and unsure of how to proceed. Having a PhD is one thing, having a title of Dr is well earned through a lot of hard work and sacrifice â€“ sure. But I think there is definitely a time and place to know when to use it and when not to use it. And on a flight booking â€“ itâ€™s a time not to. 

I found myself wondering, thinking, debating as the time out clock at the top of the check out ticked down. Should I mark myself as a Dr? I had flashes of someone on the flight having a medical emergency and the flight attendants running over to seat 25A and saying Dr, we need your help! And then having to explain that Iâ€™m a doctor of money and not of people â€“ while the flight attendant spirals deeper into more panic â€¦ would be too much for me to handle. 

I mean, I donâ€™t know of many people who would have a mid-air tax emergency or mid-air asset allocation emergency! These are issues I could help with mid flight to Sydney for sure â€“ heart attacks â€“ not so much. 

Iâ€™m reminded that being a non-medical doctor has numerous benefits and applications in my field â€“ and just thatâ€¦ in my field, in my classroom and in my lane. Iâ€™m not sure I want to venture out of my lane too much ðŸ˜Š 

I did not mark myself as Dr on my flight and there was no mid-air medical emergency â€“ but all the same. 

As you can see â€“ I donâ€™t take myself too seriously ðŸ˜Š
