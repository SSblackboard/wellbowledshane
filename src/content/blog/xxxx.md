“During a gold rush, sell shovels” is a quote connected with the 19th century Californian gold rush. There is a lot of articles on this subject, but the idea has stayed with me and influences both my investments and career moves. 

The first millionaire from the California gold rush was Samuel Brannan, who sold gold prospecting gear to hopeful miners. The miners were there to strike gold and make it rich, but Brannan made a great bet that he made small amounts of money from many people, instead of betting on one event – striking gold. Sure, he could have followed the crowd and looked for gold but instead took a hedged position, if you will.

Hedging is a strategy to minimise exposure to specific types of risk and involves taking an opposite position. Now in pure finance is hedges’ value is linked to the value of an underlying asset. Brannan effectively bet there would be hundreds of thousands of hopeful miners coming to find the motherload of gold, and not that there was a gold. The rumours of gold fuelled the incoming stream of hopeful miners and Brannan was selling the tools to enable their dreams. 

Levi Strauss followed a similar path selling hardy riveted blue jeans to any and all hopeful gold prospector. 

**Transit Protocol** wrote a good article in 2020 on Medium.com and this paragraph stuck out for me: “So, instead of trying to be the next WhatsApp or Youtube or SnapChat, why not think about what those companies need to be successful and build a company to support those efforts.” It’s an interesting idea to reduce the risk of my business or investing in a business. 

This seems like the boring or safe route to me, and it probably is. But I think there is something to be said for the boring – its usually in need by the excited. I recently had a conversation with a Venture Capitalist who described one of things he looks for in an investment or rather what he likes in his investments. He like the company he invests in to be ‘boring’. Boring in the sense that they are services and / or products that are in high demand that sit in the background and continually deliver value. From his perspective he probably likes the reduction in risk or adverse outcomes and improved prospects of earning recurring revenue. 

Nvidia could be a good example of selling shovels, albeit A.I. shovels.
