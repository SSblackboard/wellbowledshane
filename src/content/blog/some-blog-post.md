This is probably a pedantic post, I’ll admit. But its important to me and I think holds a valuable lesson that I aim to pass down to my kids.

Around the house, I try to make sure that there is zero unnecessary waste, especially food – it drives me crazy when we’ve bought a 60g bag of Baby Spinach for a whopping $2.00 and it sits in the bottom of the fridge, goes off and we end up throwing it out unopened. What a waste of my life (0.05 life hours by the way) for the privilege of being part of the spinach rot journey. 

What a waste.

I focus on things around my house where I can make a difference and can make a positive impact on the way I live and the way my family lives. To be clear, this is not about saving the $2 spinach charge from the grocery bill. It’s a way of approaching decisions, it’s a culture of how I (and hopefully) my family make decisions. 

I have a few – lets call them principles I try to follow and encourage my family to follow: 

* 	**Zero waste, especially food**. It a mindset and a non-negotiable for me. My mother used to say, don’t; waste food there are many kids out there without food. 
* 	**Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth**. Again, its not about the cost of running the tap for 2 minutes unnecessarily – it’s the act of wasting water (not to mention the environmental impacts). 
* 	**Turn off the lights after leaving a room**. This is a big one for me – coming home to three people using 2 rooms and every room in the house has lights on, drives me crazy. Turning off the lights when leaving a room is a disciplined act and commitment to a zero-waste mindset.  
* 	If you’re hot open a window before using the **aircon** and if you’re cold, put on a jacket before using the heater. Growing up air-cons and heaters weren’t a thing or were a luxury for those +40-degree days.  
* 	**Turn off the TV once you’re done watching**. And No the dogs don’t need the TV on to keep them company when we are out. 
* 	**Use the tumble drier only in emergencies** – enough said, it needs to be raining for at least 5 days before the tumble dryer sees action.   
* 	**At the end of the tomato sauce bottle** – putting in a bit of water and shaking the bottle to get the last tiny remaining bit of sauce out… Okay that is insane I know and I’m aware of how it looks – but I can’t help myself and still do it. Don’t judge me… lets be friends! 

A story that has stuck with me my whole life and I think my sister told it to me. I think she was secretly waging psychological warfare against me. She said: “it costs $1 every time you turn on and off a light switch.” My zero-waste thinking that I was probably born with, and my sisters ‘advice’ drove me to live for many years in dark rooms. 

The point of this article is to highlight not necessarily the savings from activities like listed above (there are savings but minimal in the grand scheme of things), but this way of thinking begins to spill over into other areas of my life. Like how much I buy at the grocery store, how I drive (cautiously as to conserve fuel or in eco-mode), how I save and invest, how I spend my money on things that bring me and my family joy. Consider your culture at home and what you want that to be and begin cultivating and work on it – it has an overflowing impact into other areas of your life.
