Private Equity investors generally make investments in a company by agreeing up front to a dollar value (based on the total value of the company) and equity stake (how much of the company they will own). Much like you’ll see on investor shows like ‘Shark Tank’ or ‘Dragons Den’. An entrepreneur is looking to raise money and wealthy investors are looking to invest in the next big idea or at least a company that will in the future make them more money. 

What’s not really that clear, or at least for me, it wasn’t that clear is that the investor usually doesn’t just hand over all of the agreed cash on day 1 or after signing the contract. They invest this money in stages or milestones, they slowly and cautiously release the funds to the entrepreneur once they have hit certain performance metrics. These could be metrics like: revenue earned, number of paying customers, supplier contract signed, site traffic…etc. Whatever performance metrics relevant to the specific business that show their progress and reveal if they are winning more business, making more money or earning more market share.  

There are two main reasons I can think of, for this approach:

1. Risk and 
2. Incentive. 

**Risk**

This approach reduces the risk for the investor or losing all their investment. Let me use an example: If an investor agrees to invest $125,000 into a private manufacturing business. They could release this cash to the entrepreneur in batches of $25,000 based on milestones of paid orders. First $25,000 immediately after the contract is signed as an injection into the business to get them started. Then on sales milestones of every 1,000 units sold. I can see for the investor this will reduce their risk, if the business is selling more and more, some of the risks associated with the business are reduced like: Is there a market? Are they customers willing to pay for the product?...etc. A risk reduces the investor will feel more and more comfortable in investing their funds.  

**Incentive**

If there is a staged flow of investment to the business, there is an incentive for the entrepreneur to hit very specific and measurable milestones. Sales is usually an easily quantifiable metric that is widely understood. The entrepreneur’s focus is narrowed to perform on specific targets to prove the idea, grow the business and unlock the next round of funding. 

If I have an opportunity to invest, I follow a similar process. I usually don’t jump all in at the beginning, I invest over time and consider the evidence (performance) of the company as new information to inform my next round (if any) of investment. With listed investments, there is more information and history available to make investment decisions but with private / unlisted businesses – I feel the risks associated with these are higher.
