I’m not saying credit providers and drug dealers are the same… But there are similarities between them. Let me explain. 

By credit providers I mean those companies that offer you loans, very broad and encompasses a large apart of the financial system – let’s think about credit card providers. By drug dealers, in my head I’m thinking of dealers on TV shows standing on street corners at night selling small quantities of illegal goods. 

Let me explain a bit further… I’ll start with drug dealers first. I’ve heard of a strategy that dealers offer ‘tasters’ to clients to sample their product. The idea is for the client to return satisfied with their taster and make a purchase. The hope, for the dealer at least, is to expand their client list and improve profitability. **The hook for the client to get started.** 

Credit card providers so something strangely similar. Some credit card providers offer interest free periods on cards – that is, if you sign up to a credit card with a limit of $5,000 you won’t pay any interest on the amount you owe for the first 55 days. I’m guess what the next actions would be and have no evidence of this, but I can imagine what would happen. The client gets the card, they make a few small purchases and after one or two pay cycles, they repay the outstanding balance. Thereby not paying any interest. **The hook for the client to get started.**

Happy and content with their actions the credit card client goes a few more weeks without using the card but the idea of having access to that $5,000 is in the back of their heads. Until Black Friday rolls around or some other artificially manufactured “Savings Event” and all hell breaks loose. The client maxes out the card on ‘essential savings’ or makes purchases that can’t be repaid within the 55-day interest period.     

I’m not saying credit providers and drug dealers are the same… but in my opinion there are similarities between them that raise Red Flags for me. The Red Flag for me is that nothing is ‘free’ its all a hook with the aim of getting me to do something in the future that’s most likely going to benefit the other party more than it will benefit me. 

**Disclaimer**: as you can see, I’m not a fan of credit card providers. I don’t know any drug dealers personally but assume some of them are nice people – the product they sell is generally a societal negative and does harm. The moral of my story and opinion is: watch out for ‘offers’ and ‘approaches’ that these two groups use and guard yourself against them.
