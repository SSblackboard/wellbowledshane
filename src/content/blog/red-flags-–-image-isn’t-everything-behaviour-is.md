In my younger years, I used to be impressed with image. How a person dressed, what car they drove, what suburb they lived in, the title of their job…etc. 

To be clear, I’m referring to material items that people use to portray a specific image about themselves, like success or wealth or status. 

Using the example of a driving a luxury car for the moment, I think it’s safe to say driving an uber expensive car like a Ferrari is an attempt for the owner to do one or both:

1. Convey a message and / or 
2. As a reward to themselves for hard work or an achievement.  

I think it’s important to consider what message it trying to be sent by the person and why they are sending it in the first place. There is value in understanding this signalling and what it ultimately means for me and my decision-making processes. 

When I see a person diving a flash car, wearing designer clothes or accessories I’ve often wondered about a few things, like: 

* Have they paid if off in full or have taken debt to pay it off? 
* What kind of house do they live in and if it’s a one-bedroom apartment or a mansion? 

The answers to my questions would inform my opinion of the decision-making of the other person. Going into debt, for me isn’t a good decision – especially for a depreciating asset (something you own that loses value and it worth less tomorrow than it is today). 

How that person allocates their funds also tells me what it important to them and gives insights into their decision making. For instance, if you drive the latest model Mercedes Benz, wear designer branded clothes and live in a one-bedroom apartment – this provides information on how you choose to allocate your funds.

I’m not judging, how another person spends their funds is none of my business. It does provide me with information, and I’ll use it to inform my decision making. For instance, who’s advice I trust or not, who I include into my friendship groups both professional and personally. 

Image is an interesting area to delve into and I’m sure I subconsciously portray an image. I’d hope its not excess, perhaps its too thrifty, and maybe over optimistic. Judging too quickly based on appearances has led me to incorrect conclusions in the past, both being fooled and writing people off too quickly. 

Over the years I’ve realised that some of the most genuine people I’ve met and have had the pleasure to work with come dressed in leather jackets, ride motorbikes and have tattoos to the max. Some of the worst are dressed in suits and ties - with [pinky rings](https://wellbowledshane.com.au/post/red-flags-never-trust-a-man-who-wears-a-pinky-ring/).
