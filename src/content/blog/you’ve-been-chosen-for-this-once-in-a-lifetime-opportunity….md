Early in my career, I worked in banking and for a German Venture Capitalist work worked out of Chicago. It’s a weird one, I know. My German VC boss was named Dirk is probably the smartest but most direct person I’ve every worked with. Well read, experienced, being educate by an Ivy league institution and working in finance in Chicago. All round intimidating to a young fresh university undergraduate.

Having worked there for a few months, I was getting the hand of the systems, the processes and the ‘way we do business’ and overall enjoying it. 

Being in financial services and banking in particular, I was on top of the market movements and drivers. Putting in the very little spare cash I had into shares and then watching them like a hawk as they moved each day. In hindsight, this constant watching the market wasn’t a good strategy for me – my feelings of wealth began to mirror the market movements. Up one day, down the next. My investments today are quite different in that sense – it’s the set and forget method in either a blue-chip share or ETF or a wildly speculatively punt that may or may not come off in the future (a very small part of the portfolio). 

Always looking at and for investments, one day I received a cold call from a “Trader in London”. Being naïve I heard the ‘trader’ out and he gave me his pitch. It sounded great, a shoo-in, can’t fail, and made for me investment. My spider senses should have been tingling at this point… but they were underdeveloped at this point in my career… 

I ended the call and was pumped, optimistic with this win-win can’t lose situation that had magically found me… me amongst all the people at the bank, all the people in investing – I was the lucky one!!! Whoa!

A couple days past and I was on the verge of clicking the buy button when I thought I should just ask Dirk what he thought. Part of me wanted his advice and part of me wanted to look like a superstar investor who had stumbled upon this once in a lifetime opportunity…. It did not end well… 

Dirk was an ominous presence with circular purple tinted glasses and a thick German ascent. 

I cornered Dirk at the end of a meeting and pitched the idea and story to him. One minute into the pitch, he stopped me and asked one simple question… “Why would they choose you for this “opportunity”? 

I believe he wasn’t meaning to be mean; he was ultra direct and unfiltered without emotion. He was meaning well. He had my best interests at heart, but his delivery was brutal. Brutally honest and something I wasn’t prepared for. 

My dreams crashed around me and my future ended. There wasn’t anywhere to hide, and it hurt my immature ego. I was offended! 😊 I had no response, and the awkward encounter ended. 

After a few days of questioning myself, whether the opportunity was true or not, doing more research 

But this experience taught me one of my most valuable lessons. Asking why me, but more exactly asking the motivations of another person. Why would they approach me for this? Nothing comes easy and nothing worthwhile is easy… once in a lifetime opportunities don’t exist, they are marketing gimmicks used to sell to suckers. 

Bill Gates famously said: “Buses are like opportunities, there’s always another one coming around.” 



My Lesson: when you feel so special to be chosen by someone for a once in a lifetime opportunity – **beware… you’re the mark.**
