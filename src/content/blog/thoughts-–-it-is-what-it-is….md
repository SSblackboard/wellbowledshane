Short and sweet thought here. 

Have you ever had a saying, that irritates you. I mean a saying used frequently by people that annoys the hell out of you! I have many but there is a special one that I really, really dislike. 

**“It Is, What It Is”.** 

Everyone in my family know this and before they use it – they say, “I know you don’t like this, but It Is, What It Is…” 

The reason I don’t like this saying is because its defeatist, that is they are expecting or excessively ready to accept failure with the belief that further effort would be useless. Its probably the eternal optimist in me that is at odds with this way of thinking. There also something that can be done, always ready to give it a go and make a plan to fix or improve a situation.  

I’m also a realist and need to see that in some situation it may be over, I may have lost fair and square, but it won’t be without trying all options, giving it a red-hot crack and if that doesn’t work out – alright. 

I wonder about people using this phase and their view of the world. Is the world seen by them as something that’s happening to them? Or is it because they feel they have little bearing on the direction of events, their environment around happening around them? Curious thought…

In any event – please never use this saying.
