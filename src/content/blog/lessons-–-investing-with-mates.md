A few years ago, I was involved in a private property investment syndicate. It involved a bunch of mates, there were 10 of us in total, who decided that it would be a good idea to form a company whose purpose was to buy residential property and rent it out.

The idea was that the company would own residential apartments, a mixture of one-, two- and three-bedroom units across a particular city. The rents collected (less maintenance and strata fees) on the properties would go back into paying off the mortgage of the property. 

The investment kicked off with each of the ten shareholders contributing a fixed sum into the company on a monthly basis over a year. These funds would accumulate until there was enough for a deposit on the first apartment. The first apartment was purchased and rented out, the rental amount less any running costs like maintenance or strata fees would be put straight onto the mortgage. The shareholders continued to contribute the fixed amount to the company, and this helped pay down the mortgage on the apartment faster. So, the mortgage was being paid off rapidly. 

Once the first apartment was paid off, the shareholders contribution plus the rent on the first property would go into saving for the second properties deposit. Once enough deposit was saved for the second apartment, one would be purchased and rented out. So, the second property would be paid off faster by the rent it collected, rent from the first property as well as the shareholders contributions. 

The process would be repeated until multiple properties rent collections were paying off the next property until a portfolio of properties were accumulate and paid off completely. That was the idea and the plan, but not everything goes according to plan, as I learnt valuable lessons... 

**Lessons:**

1. **Friendships do get in the way.** One of my closest friends was part of the syndicate and disagreeing with them or not siding with them on issues created some friction. Best to discuss this upfront and separate business from pleasure. 


2. **Timelines don’t always align.** Certain shareholders were naturally more aggressive in their growth ambitions that others and wanted to take on more risk than the group thought necessary. This created a continual agreement over aggressive versus passive or organic growth. 


3. **Individual circumstances** change and the longer the timeline of the scheme or syndicate the less certainty the group had. Some shareholders got married, had kids, got retrenched from their jobs and created friction in the continual shareholders contribution. Especially because the percentage ownership of shareholders in the syndicate was tied to the same / equal monthly shareholder contributions. 


4. **Agreements are critical and the detail matters only when things go wrong**. The shareholder agreement and constitution of the syndicate are critically important and like all contracts are only really needed when things are not performing as they were expected to perform. Which is generally always. 


5. **Shareholding percentages will change**, and they can’t be static. Our syndicate tied monthly contributions to the percentage ownership of each shareholder. Problematic if a shareholder couldn’t afford the monthly contribution. 


6. **Liquidity is a major risk and issue**. The underlying asset of the syndicate will determine how easy or difficult it is to exit your position. That is if a shareholder wants to sell their stake, will this require a sale of an apartment to fund the exit. Or rules need to be in place around who of the current shareholders can buy the stake or will every remaining shareholder be required to buy an equal stake. 


7. **Personal liability needs careful consideration.** As it turns out banks are not that willing to lend to twenty somethings in a syndicate and each shareholder had to sign personal guarantee on the first mortgage. Each shareholder was jointly and severally liable for the loan – a big risk for everyone involved. 


8. **Be careful who you invite into the syndicate**, there were people in the syndicate that I would not deal with again and some who are still mates. Considering the timeframes of this syndicate, I should have chosen better shareholders. 


9. **Patience is a virtue not many have mastered.** Being young and all men in this syndicate, patience didn’t seem like a common trait we shared. Some were more than happy for this to grow over 20+ years, others wanted or seemingly needed this to shoot the light out over 3 to 5 years. This caused some friction within the group. 


10. **Decide who does the dirty work**. The syndicate shareholders can’t all be passive, there are time when we need to evict a tenant – obviously dirty work and someone must be responsible for it. 



Looking back the idea of this syndicate seems like a good one at the time, but I don’t think I’d enter into another one again. There are too many points where things change, views differ, and structural frictions caused disagreements and discontent. I’d prefer investing and managing my own timelines, circumstances, liability, patience and liquidity rather than experiencing a consensus approach to investing. 

Still the idea of a syndicate remains appealing – it’s just not for me.
