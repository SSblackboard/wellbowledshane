In the finance classes I teach at University, I often arrive at a debate about value. What is it? What’s the definition of value? And how do investors, like Venture Capitalists and Private Equity investors add value to their investments? 

Value is a subjective concept. What I consider valuable, my neighbour considers junk and vice versa. It’s the reason that “Buy Nothing” neighbourhood groups exist on Facebook. I place zero or very little value on an unwanted item, but a neighbour may see so much value to hire a trailer to come to my house and pick up a table, bed frame or chest of drawers. 

When I worked in Ghana, I was developing new innovative financial products for small business owners. In that process I spoke to formal and informal business owners and operators. Once conversation I had with an informal trader stuck with me and always reminds me that value is subjective. She sold fruit and vegetables on the side of the road and told me that each day she gets up at 3:30 in the morning to secure her trading spot on the corner of the busiest street. To me it was a street corner in 40-degree heat with unknown fragrances wafting through the air. But to her it met more sales, more profits to buy more stock for the next days trading, it meant food on her table that evening. Our perspective and perceptions of value in that moment were polar opposites. 

The difference in value in the Buy Nothing Facebook groups and the Ghanaians trader example is based on utility, a quick Wikipedia search and I get this definition: “In economics, utility is a measure of the satisfaction that a certain person has from a certain state of the world.” The table or bed frame has more utility to my neighbour than it does for me.   

**For me it looks like this:** 

* ```
  If there I have a high utility (high satisfaction levels), the more likely I am going to persist or continue as is and the low likelihood I’ll change course.  
  ```
* ```
  If there I have a low utility (low satisfaction levels), the less likely I am going to persist or continue as is and the higher likelihood I’ll change course.  
  ```

An example of this would be an established business is making heaps of money selling product A, there would be an incentive to persist or maintain the status quo as long as possible to extract as much profits as possible. A start-up wanting to disrupt the established business wants to do everything it can to break the status quo to reveal a new way of doing things, so it can one day make heaps of money selling product B. 

When I think about value from the perspective of investing, its centred around the idea of how much is this investment going to contribute to my overall goal of being financial independent. That is, being debt free, owing my house outright, having enough saved to live a comfortable life are my goals. Am I saving, investing, spending, earning towards my desired future state. 

Value is subjective and if you’ve ever watched “Shark Tank” or “Dragons Den” TV shows the investors usually place a higher value on their business than the sharks or dragons do. There is usually a gap in their valuations, and this is based on their perceptions of the current value of the business. The investor is valuing the business today, but the entrepreneur is usually discounting future value into a figure today. The negotiation process attempts to find some common ground between the two parties so a deal can be done, the investor wants to buy an equity stake in the business and the entrepreneur is looking for funding, guidance, access to networks, strategic advice amongst other investors.  

So why is this a Red Flag…

Value can also be seen as a shared illusion, a state that may not exist. Utility placed on an object, business, location, idea…etc. That may or may not have any utility or satisfaction. Misplaced utility really. I am naturally a positive person and look for value in concepts, ideas, or plans. Leaning towards finding value can be dangerous for me. It’s as if, sometimes, I’m search for reasons to believe instead of finding supporting evidence. 

In one of the MBA Classes I teach on Private Equity and Venture Capital investing, I invited an industry expert into the class as a guest speaker. He described the process of valuing a company as both the investor and entrepreneur arriving and agreeing on a valuation as both parties: **“having a shared delusion.”** 

I find this equally hilarious and horrifying, other meanings of the word delusion are misunderstanding, misbelief, false impression, hallucination, mirage and a figment of the imagination.  

I suppose that if when I’m looking at an investment, I need to consider what Kool-Aid I’m drinking to get me to the share delusional state contains – i.e. what assumptions I’m willing to accept or reject. 

**Value is a shared delusion – be cautious.**
