Ask, what’s the worst that can happen? This is a mantra I have followed a lot, more so recently in my life. I’ve grown more accustomed to asking for discounts, asking for a lower price and asking for what I want. 

There are three probable outcomes when I ask for a discount, simply: Yes, No or a compromise. Two of the three outcomes are a win in my eyes – Yes – saving money or a compromise, savings a smaller amount of money. The compromise would usually be you’ve asked for a 5% discount, how about a 2,5% discount. I’ll still take 2,5% over not discount.  

Every six months or so I call up my bank and blatantly ask them to lower my home loan rate. Usually they say No, but once they lowered it marginally. Still a savings and over a 30-year mortgage – it adds up to be worth the time and effort to call in. 

I used to think that banks or insurers or retailers who said No to my request would be an embarrassing event. I used to hate calling in and talking to someone and often used a comparison site. But I found out talking to someone face to face or on a call isn’t as bad as I originally thought. It’s like asking someone on a dinner date – If they say Yes, that’s great, if they say No, oh well – I’ll look for someone else who I see a match with. Similarly, when I’m looking for a job – I’ll apply for any and all jobs that sound enjoyable and that I think I’ll enjoy, regardless of the stated requirements. 8/10 – I won’t even hear back from the recruiter or company; 1.5/10 I’ll get a rejection email BUT… 0.5/10 I might get to an interview where I’ll showcase my mad skills. There are interesting articles about self-rejection and especially the difference in self-rejection rates between men and women. Tara Mohr wrote an exceptional HBR piece about this – link at the end of the article.  

I try not to self-reject anymore; this is the act of pre-empting the rejection of another person or organisation by rejecting yourself or opting out first. People and companies say No to me all the time, but I’m not going to die wondering… 

Here’s my hit list:

* ```
  Bank – mortgage,
  ```
* ```
  Bank – credit card rate,
  ```
* ```
  Car insurance, 
  ```
* ```
  Home and content insurer,
  ```
* ```
  Pet insurer,
  ```
* ```
  Internet provider,
  ```
* ```
  Mobile provider,
  ```
* ```
  Gas provider,
  ```
* ```
  Electricity provider
  ```

If you’re interested in a Harvard Business Review article on the difference between men and women in self -rejection, when it comes to job applications, read this article, super interesting:
