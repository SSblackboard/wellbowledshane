I’ve always been sceptical of any professional that earns their income off a single transaction and not from an on-going relationship that is built on performance. By this I mean those brokers or intermediaries that get paid form a once off deal. 

I’m not saying that these professionals are in any way sub-par, or corrupt or deceptive in any way. It just doesn’t sit well with me that our motivations may not be aligned if I’m in it for the long haul and the brokers aim is to get the deal done.

I’d prefer to pay more in performance fees over a longer period than a smaller chunk upfront. This will align our priorities, objectives and agendas more closely, that is, if I do well, we do well and vice versa. 

I may have trust issues but being this is built over time. A relationship offers you time and space to suss out the broker and understand how they perform, how they operate and if they are aligned to what I want to achieve.   

**Examples:**

**Estate Agents:** 

* ```
  An estate agent that sells your house and earns a commission– I feel wants to close the deal. 
  ```
* ```
  An estate agent that rents out your house – has a vested long-term interest in the performance of the rental income stream
  ```

**Recruiters:**

* ```
  A recruiter who earns a commission from placing you in a permanent role – I feel wants to close the deal.
  ```
* ```
  A recruiter who places you at an employer and earns an on-going commission just as long as you’re employed in your role. 
  ```

**Share trading:**

* ```
  A stockbroker who earns a commission on buying or selling shares for you – I feel wants to close the deal.
  ```
* ```
  An asset manager who manages a portfolio of shares and is paid a performance fee when the portfolio has positive returns.  
  ```

In each of the overly simplified examples above, there is a different level of invested interest between the parties. I’m super cautious when dealing with professional who want to close a deal – not all estate agents, recruiters or traders are the same. This thinking shapes my approach and I’ll be more cautious, more detailed and more pessimistic when dealing with a professional who earns off a single transaction.

**Lesson:** Professionals who earn off a single transaction need to be played with caution (trust Is earned in building a relationship).
