I was a teenager in the 90’s and for whatever reason I grew up listening to rap music. None of my friends really listened to it and none of my family enjoyed it. I still do enjoy it, not the latest rap music so much but mostly still 90’s and 2000’s music. A lot of truth is contained in rap music (a lot of horseshit too), but I waded through the lyrics and related to many lessons contained in the best of the best verses.  

The song "Moment of Clarity" by Jay-Z, on his 2003 album, “The Black Album”, there’s a line at about 2:13:

**“I can’t help the poor if I’m one of them, so I got rich and gave back. To me that’s a win-win.”**

I was studying at university at the time and knew I wanted to be in finance and wanted to make money. But this song and lyrics crystalised what I needed to do not only for myself but for my siblings and mom. Make as money as possible so I can rely on myself, and my family (siblings and mom) can reply on me.

My ‘give back’ was to act as a financial safety if required for those closest to me. I didn’t think so at the time, but on reflection I potentially became too hyper focussed and driven to achieve academically and to climb the financial ladder as quickly as possible. I learnt new academic skills through more and more studies and tended to job hop to achieve quick wins in salary increases. On reflection, I would have spent more time learning more practical skills or more on the job skills than academic skills. I sometimes think to myself I should have pursued a Chartered Accountant (CA) or Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) route more than a PhD.      

That besides the point, the capitalist idea of doing financially well was deeply ingrained in my outlook on life. The belief that if I did extraordinarily well, I’d be benefitting not only my family but my community at large. My family’s prospects in life would be better and my community would indirectly benefit from more service provision due to increased tax revenue. 

I’ve realised I’m not going to have Elon Musk money, but I’ll aim to be the Elon Musk of my family. Minus some of the radical ideology and actions. I’ll outwork competitors to make sure I achieve my goal of providing the best prospects for my family as possible and for me that’s enough of a win-win.
