I’m a reformed university lecturer and academic, I spent all of my university life studying, teaching and writing about finance and investment related topics. All of my professional experience has been in financial services, working in credit, insurance and savings products and services. 

I’ve always enjoy reading and researching all aspects of money management, trading, investments and the variety of approaches we all take to thinking (or ignoring) money. 

My opinions, ideas and thoughts in this blog are just my ways of thinking about money. My hope is that you enjoy some or all of the articles and just maybe learn something or see money in a new way or improve your relationship with money. 

If nothing else, I hope you have one or two chuckles about my weird money quirks.
