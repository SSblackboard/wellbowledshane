An interesting theme I’ve noticed amongst successful investors, like private equity and venture capital investors, is that the seem to have an exit plan when they make an investment. 

As background, Private Equity (PE) and Venture Capital (VC) investors generally invest in privately held companies that have abnormally high growth prospects. Think technology businesses that could scale and grow very quickly. VCs invest in early-stage companies, these are those potentially with just idea, or a handful of customers, new technology or the likes. PE investors invest in later stage companies that have validated their product or service, seen some market traction and potential heading towards or have reached break even point.  

In both cases PE and VC investors have similar approaches and goals, although their decision making differs significantly – they both have the same end game. This is to exit their investments (sell their ownership stake) in that company for a profit, a huge profit. The traditional benchmark is to make 10 x (10 times) their initial investment. They invest $100,000, they aim to sell that stake for $1,000,000. The timelines to do this are anywhere between 5 – 7 years and could take longer, up to 10 years. 

The point of this article is to highlight one key decision point both PE and VC investors make very early on it their investment decision, sometimes even before they make the investment. They consider how they’ll realise their 10x return, who will they sell this to and how that sale will happen. This is called their exit. How they will realise that return before the investment is made. 

I’ve spoken to PE investors that go and talk to potential acquiring targets, that is companies that would likely buy them out before investing a cent. The investor found out what systems they use, best practices, what they look for in a potential acquisition target and even brand guidelines. Then the investor went back to their investment opportunity, invested and built the business using the same systems, processes and procedures that the purchasing company uses. This made it so much more compelling to the purchaser when they were looking to buy it. This clear exit plan is something to take note of. 

When investing or making any money decision, look at the exit plan. How will you realise value? Is it along the way through regular dividends and interest payments? Or is it at the end of a specified period?     

If you’re investing in listed instruments (like shares on a stock exchange), it’s an easier thought – just sell them when I’ve reached my goal. But for unlisted or private investments, it’s a bit trickier. However, in both instances - Have an exit plan before you invest.
