This is a bit of a weird one and to be honest I’m not sure about the validity of this red flag rule, but it’s stuck with me.

I was in a bar, having a few cold Pepsi’s and chatting away with mate when an older, well weather grey haired, bearded man got talking to a group of us. Obviously, a bit worse for wear from too many Pepsi’s blurted out this: “Nothing good happens after 10:30 at night.” 

At the time, I laughed it off, but it got me thinking and researching… [Salaam Bhatti](https://medium.com/@salaam/nothing-good-happens-after-10-pm-dd4249b3e2ce) wrote an article in 2017 on Medium.com entitled, “Nothing Good Happens After 10 PM.” The article describes building a sustainable model that essentially promotes balance in lifestyle with no excesses. 

I get this and subscribe to the proposed model – however my lesson from my Pepsi’ed up homeless looking mate elicits thoughts of going out and debaucherous evenings. 

The rational side of me thinks this: “10:30 to me seems like a good point in the evening to head home, call it a night because nothing good happens from thereon in”. 

The Pepsi’ed up, side of me thinks, “**Let it rain!**”. 

Now, some of my best (and untellable) stories come from mates in the wee hours of the morning after a few cold ones. Also, there have been not so nice encounters and experience (that will never be spoken of) that have occurred in the same wee hours of the morning – or after 10:30. 

There’s something to be said for this mantra, however it needs to be situational. So out at a bar – on the Pepsi’s after 10:30, spider senses should be giving you the idea that things could go downhill fast. At a mate’s house after 10:30, potentially less chance of a downward spiral. At your own house on the couch with your partner, a few red Pepsi’s in hand, binging Netflix and its 10:31 – you’re golden, that’s quality time. 

In all seriousness, as much as can be mustered from the beforementioned text, in my experience the only value to find after 10:30 from an investment perspective is to observe people’s behaviour. Behaviour is an information source that is like striking gold. How one behaves, even after a few delightfully garnished Pepsi’s, provides useful information. Make sure to take note. 



**Disclaimer:** I hope that once you’ve read this article you realise that ‘Pepsi’ does not referred to the deliciously refreshing drink Pepsi, however it does refer to various alcoholic beverages like beer, wine or margaritas. #PepsiDoesntTasteTheSameAsACoke
