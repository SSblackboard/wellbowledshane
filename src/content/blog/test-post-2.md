This is how I think of money…

I’ve worked for a pay cheque my entire life, that is working for companies and universities that pay me a wage in exchange for the work I did. As my career continued and as my skill set grew, I received increases and promotions and my pay cheque naturally increased. 

I’ve always wondered about this transaction, because it is a transaction – I give the organisation time and effort and they give me cash. It’s a ‘this for that’ transaction. But what exactly am I exchanging in this transaction? Time and effort – the effort part is easily to define. Its output, results and performance. Make a sale, produce a spreadsheet model, derive insights, give a lecture, bag groceries, dig a hole in the ground…etc. 

The time piece is a bit more interesting to consider… By time I mean my life, I’m exchange my finite life for a pay cheque. No this isn’t a groundbreaking concept, but it massively impacts the way I think about spending my money. 

I earn my wages for the fortnight. I work 7.5 hours a day for 10 days (Monday to Friday) in a usual fortnight, that is 75 hours in total. I know my net salary that’s paid into my bank account each fortnight, let’s say its $3,000 (I know we are sharing here but we’re not sharing real salary information, not sharing that much) … 

So, to get to what I call my **Life Rate** – the amount of money per hour your paid into your bank account is: 

$3,000 / 75 = $40 per **Life hour**. 

This shapes how I spend my money and how I think about what I buy: 

* ```
  Ballet lessons for my daughter - $160 per term = 4 life hours
  ```
* ```
  Rugby lessons for my son - $200 per term = 5 life hours
  ```
* ```
  Groceries = $250 per week = 6.25 life hours
  ```
* ```
  Stan subscription = $27 per month = 0.675 life hours
  ```
* ```
  Apple subscription = $4.49 per month = 0.112 life hours
  ```
* ```
  Haircut = $33 per cut = 0.825 life hours
  ```

Its mostly an annoying way to think about it, because it really focusses my spending. Am I really going to exchange my life hour for this item or service? Do I really need another scatter cushion and is exchanging 2 life hours a glass flower vase actually worth it? 

I prioritise my spending like this and try to avoid wasting my life hours – not always successfully but it helps me to allocate my money as best as possible. I still buy stuff that I think back and reflect that it was a bad decision – but I’m getting a little bit wiser each day. 

**Disclaimer:** Beer and coffee are always worth it. And by the way, a pint at my local pub costs me 0.3 life hours and a coffee costs me 0.1375 life hours and they are both definitely worth it.
