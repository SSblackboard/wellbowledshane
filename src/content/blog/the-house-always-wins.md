“The house always wins” is a saying that’s intrigued and bothered mean in equal proportions. Essentially its saying that the “house” of the established player always eventually comes out on tops. 

Rather, on balance, or **‘Nett’** the house wins – why else would they be in business? 

Casinos, Banks and I’m going to through Lawyers onto that pile – will on balance, come out on top. I find that each has similar traits or behaviours to lure me into playing with fire. Take casinos, they sometimes and especially if you are winning or are ‘up’ offer you free drinks. Their agenda is twofold, to keep me playing since they know the longer, I play the higher the likelihood I’ll give back my winnings and lose some of my money and secondly to get me to drink enough to make some poor or risky decisions like putting it all on RED in roulette. 

I find banks follow a similar strategy. They will offer frequent flyer miles or interest free periods in order to lure me into seemingly attractive credit card deals. My sense is that the more I use the credit card the higher the likelihood I’ll end up paying interest back to them. 

Free advice from lawyers – could this be the same? I’m not entirely sure, but they are lawyers and should be lumped in with gamblers and bankers. Just kidding. But the free period may create a dependency or create the need for work, they will charge for. Management consultants loosely follow a similar behavioural pattern. Both should be solving themselves out of a job instead may create dependencies that create work and are billable hours. 

In any event, these institutions, banks and casinos exist because they make a profit. They are in the business to return profits to shareholders through value extraction. For casinos it’s through player losses, food and alcohol sales and potentially hotels and related, but mainly player losses in my opinion. Banks make money from their net interest margin (the difference between the interest they charge and the interest they pay) and their non-interest income (the fees they charge, i.e. account management fees, or credit card fees – noninterest related).  

When I’m dealing with either, I’m well aware the house, on balance, will win – so I’m trying to cultivate a skill of knowing when to stop. At casinos, when the free drinks start rolling in – it’s time to pack it in. 

With banks – it’s when I begin to creep over the interest free periods and the fees (interest and non-interest) start.  



**Disclaimer:** No banks, casinos or lawyers were injured in the making of this article. My opinion of these groups remains unchanged – I’m cautious in dealing with the house. In no way does this article promote gambling – the opposite actually. No when to stop gambling, banking and or lawyering.
